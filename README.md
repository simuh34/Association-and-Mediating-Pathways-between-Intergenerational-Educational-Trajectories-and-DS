# Association and Mediating Pathways between Intergenerational Educational Trajectories and Depressive Symptoms: Findings from High- and Middle-income Countries

# Overview
This project explores links between intergenerational educational trajectories (stably low/downwardly mobile/stably middle/upwardly mobile/stably high) and depressive symptoms, using data from 6 harmonized longitudinal aging studies (U.S., England, European countries, South Korea, Mexico, China). It includes 94,655 cross-sectional and 56,817 longitudinal (2010–2020) participants.
- Key findings: advantaged trajectories (e.g., stably high, upwardly mobile) correlate with lower depressive risk; household wealth is the most consistent mediator (explaining 24–34% of the link in the U.S.).
